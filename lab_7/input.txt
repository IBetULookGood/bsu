Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.

All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know

I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead

I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know

Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now

Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die

Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?

You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever

I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak

Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again

I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!

Is there hope for us?

These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet

Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon

The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.

All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know

I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead

I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs

I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know

Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now

Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die

But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out

And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever

So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak

I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!

'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear

This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?

You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me

If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end

The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too

Death is only a chapter

Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.

Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses

Roses (Roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs

And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know

We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now

Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood

Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die

If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be

I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever

I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak

And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet

We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead

I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!

Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you

We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end

The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places

Death is only a chapter

Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.

Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses

Roses (Roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs

And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know

We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now

Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood

Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die

If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be

I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever

I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak

And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet

We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead

I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!

Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you

We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end

The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places

Death is only a chapter

Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.

Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses

Roses (Roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs

And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know

We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now

Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood

Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die

If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be

I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever

I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak

And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet

We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead

I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!

Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you

We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end

The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places

Death is only a chapter

Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.

Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses

Roses (Roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs

And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know

We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now

Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood

Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die

If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be

I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew

Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever

I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak

And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet

We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead

I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!

Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you

We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end

The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places

Death is only a chapter

Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.

Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses

Roses (Roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs

And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know

We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now

Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood

Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die

If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be

I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever

I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak

And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet

We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead

I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!

Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you

We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end

The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places

Death is only a chapter

Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.

Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses

Roses (Roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs

And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know

We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now

Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood

Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die

If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be

I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever

I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak

And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet

We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead

I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!

Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you

We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end

The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places

Death is only a chapter

Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.

Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses

Roses (Roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs

And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know

We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now

Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood

Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die

If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be

I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever

I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak

And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet

We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead

I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!

Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you

We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end

The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places

Death is only a chapter

Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.

Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses

Roses (Roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs

And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know

We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now

Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood

Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die

If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be

I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever

I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak

And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet

We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead

I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!

Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you

We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end

The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places

Death is only a chapter

Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.

Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses

Roses (Roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!

It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs

And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know

We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now

Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood

Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die

If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)

The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be

I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever

I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak

And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet

We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead

I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!

Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you

We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end

The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places

Death is only a chapter

Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it.
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it.
Tell all my friends I said goodbye, clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I cant go on like this [Repeat: x2]
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I dont want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
Curtains close- take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it. I've dug my grave so god help me die in it.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
And I dug my grave, so ill lie in it.
I've made my bed so ill die in it, die in it.
And I dug my grave, and I dug my grave.
I'd rather live, than live forever!
I'm knocking on deaths door, but your already dead.
Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
Here I am, once again. just like a pack of wolves.

Its either now or fucking never.
And that night, we meant every word we said. all I can say,
All I can say for sure is, were coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, were coming up tonight
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something,
I don't want it, I just need it, and I cant believe that.
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it,
And I cant believe that [Repeat: x2]
Its getting harder just to feel alive,
Its getting harder just to feel alive.
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know, I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for...
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness
We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know
You will never know
I know something you don't know
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart, fall apart (Die)
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart
Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)
The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty
"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone
I can't see anything
The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night
I can't remember anything
Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs
We are done with giving a fuck
Fuck you!
You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own
Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!
If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever
I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself
Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself
Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy
For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.
"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes
No explanations, no fucking reasons why
I watched it eat you up, pieces fallen on the floor
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him back home again
Don't give up hope my friend, this is not the end
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too
For when he died, he took a part of you
Death is only a chapter
So let's rip out the pages of yesterday
Death is only a horizon
And I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to,
I'm ready for my sun,
I'm ready for my sun to set
This is suicide season!
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
We would climb our way to Heaven, and bring him home again
We would do anything to bring him back to you
We would do anything to end what you're going through
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way
I would climb my way to Heaven, and bring him home again
I would do anything to bring him back to you
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew
